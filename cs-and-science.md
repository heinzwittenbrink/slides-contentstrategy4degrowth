# Content and Truth

## Philosophical Considerations

> To know the semantic concept of truth for a language is to know what it is for
a sentence - any sentence - to be true, and this amounts, in one good
sense we can give to the phrase, to understanding the language.

> ... that the speakers of a language can effective
ly determine the meaning or meanings of an arbitrary expression (if it
has a meaning), and that it is the central task of a theory of meaning to
show how this is possible. ... a characterization of a
truth predicate describes the required kind of structure, and provides
a clear and testable criterion of an adequate semantics for a natural
language.

## Media, social media and desinformation

> The model, created with data from the media sources most cited during and after the election period, shows that left-wing media outlets are more closely aligned with centrist media outlets, and right-wing media sources are much more skewed and “are operating in their own media world,” Roberts said. The researchers found that this pattern was evident during the election and was even more pronounced during the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency.
