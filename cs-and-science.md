# Content and Truth

## Philosophical Considerations

> To know the semantic concept of truth for a language is to know what it is for a sentence ... to be true, and this amounts, in one good
sense we can give to the phrase, to understanding the language.

##

> ... that the speakers of a language can effective
ly determine the meaning or meanings of an arbitrary expression ..., and that it is the central task of a theory of meaning to
show how this is possible. ... a characterization of a
truth predicate describes the required kind of structure, and provides
a clear and testable criterion of an adequate semantics for a natural
language.

## Content strategy beyond relativism

- Is truth an important concept for content strategy?
- What is the relationship between truth, usefulness and usability?

# Network Propaganda

## Media, social media and desinformation

> The model, created with data from the media sources most cited during and after the election period, shows that left-wing media outlets are more closely aligned with centrist media outlets, and right-wing media sources are much more skewed and “are operating in their own media world,” Roberts said. The researchers found that this pattern was evident during the election and was even more pronounced during the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency.

> While the idea of equal time for opposing opinions makes sense in a two-party political system, it does not work for science, because science is not about opinion. It is about evidence.

##

> It may not be persuasive to everyone, but people are much more likely to accept factual information from those they can relate to or have a human connection with.

# Architecture and Degrowth


## Decarbonizing architecture


> The most existential, exciting and revolutionary challenge facing society, is to redesign our economy to protect the only biosphere we have

## Architects as role model

## Transparency and Science as Human Activity

[](https://pup-assets.imgix.net/onix/images/9780691179001.jpg?w=640)

Scientists are our experts in studying the natural world and sorting out complex issues that arise in it. ... The crucial component that separates science (and include the social as well as the natural sciences) from, for example, plumbing, is the centrality of the social vetting of claims.

> I am arguing that if we can make the overlap in our values explicit, this may, in some cases, help us to overcome distrust that is rooted in a perceived clash of values. But this is hard for most natural scientists to do.

## Referencing

- A text with hyperlinks is more convincing than a text without references to other resources
- the easier the path to the "sources" is to follow, the less a text has to rely on external guarantors for its credibility

## Horizontal Communication

> Substantial forms of existence that would be compatible with an economy without growth could, to a certain extent, socially diffuse, stabilise and act as a credible communication tool.

# Task: Designing a curriculum for climate communication

## Goal: Make information on the climate emergency actionable

## Stakeholders: Civil society, government, companies

How can the user-oriented approach of content strategy and the scientific truth claim be combined?
